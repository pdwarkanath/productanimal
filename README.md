# Product Animal

## About

🚀 If you're an entrepreneur looking to name your startup, a fun way to do it is combining the product name 🎁with that of an animal🐶

👏 foodpanda, mailchimp, hostgator are just some successful companies that have used this formula. This app helps you find that brand name for you🙌

💻 Enter a word for the product you're building and we'll generate a brand name that has a .com domain🔗 available to register🏁

❌ If you don't like it, hit 'GENERATE' again and we will try a new domain name🎉

📧 For questions, suggestions, get in touch dk@weekinmemes.com
